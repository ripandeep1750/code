''' I attempted a popularity classification of the shares, but the model accuracy wasn't that awesome. In this notebook, I will attempt to 
improve that previous model accuracy, and also attempt to do some other classfication challenges.
There will emphasize on feature selection algorthims that can be used in modelling the system for better results. Also, aside using Accuracy
as the evulation metric, I will also consider some other metric evaluation.
The process followed is highlighted below:
Data Cleaning - Noise removal
Data Transformation - Transform using log-transformation
Data Clustering - Grouping Similar Articles together.
Feature Selection and Evaluation
Machine Learning Classification
Summary and Conclusion.  '''
